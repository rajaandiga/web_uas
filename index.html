                <p>More than 50 people have been killed in a stampede at a religious gathering in northern India, officials have said. The incident took place at a satsang (a Hindu religious event) in Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh state.</p>
                <p>"A figure of nearly 50-60 deaths has been reported to me by doctors," district magistrate of Hathras Ashish Kumar said. The victims, including more than 20 women, are still being identified.</p>
                <p>Mr. Kumar said the stampede occurred as people were leaving at the end of the event. He added that a high-level committee had been formed to investigate the incident. "The primary focus of the administration is to provide all possible help to the injured and kin of the deceased," he said.</p>
                <p>The crowd had gathered for an event to celebrate the Hindu deity Shiva in Mughalgarhi village. A video shared by news agency PTI showed the wounded being brought to a hospital for treatment.</p>
                <p>"Procedure of post-mortem is underway and the matter is being investigated," official Satya Prakash in the neighbouring district of Etah said. Distressing images from the site of the accident are being circulated online.</p>
                <p>Some videos showed the injured being taken to hospitals in pick-up trucks, tuk tuks, and even motorbikes. A clip seen by the BBC showed several bodies left at the entrance of a local hospital as relatives screamed for help.</p>
